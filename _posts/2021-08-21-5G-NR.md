## WILT(What I've Learned Today)

### 1. What is Zadoff-Chu Sequence?
 -> It has same amplitude and cross-correlation nearly zero even syclic-shift this sequence. 
 -> We call it kind of CAZAC Sequence(Constant Amplitude Zero Autocorrelation Waveform).
 -> For this autocorrelation property, it is widely used to network system especially LTE/NR such as PRACH, PUSCH, PUCCH, etc mostly at Uplink Channel.  



### 2. QCL (Quasi Co-Located)
 -> It is also terms of communication system.
