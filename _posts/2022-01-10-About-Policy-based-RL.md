## Policy based Reinforce learning

### I will list some famous, named algorithms.

 -> REINFORCE
 
 -> Actor-Critic
 
 -> Off-Policy   = proposes Experience Replay + Target Policy
 
 -> A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)
 
 -> A2C (Advantage Actor Critic)
 
 -> DPG (Deterministic Policy Gradient)    = Deterministic algorithm
 
 -> DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)
 
 -> D4PG (Distributed Distributional DDPG)
 
 -> MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)
 
 -> TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization)
 
 -> PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)              = simplifying TRPO
 
 -> ACER (Actor-Critic with Experience Replay)
 
 -> ACKTR (Actor-Critic using Krnoecker-factored Trust Region)
 
 -> SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)
 
 -> TD3 (Twin Delayerd Deep Determisitic Policy Gradient)
