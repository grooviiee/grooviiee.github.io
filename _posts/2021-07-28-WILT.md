## WILT(What I've Learned Today)

### 1. What is Redux?
 -> Use state variable as a global variable.
 
 -> In react, we can hand over state value using 'props'. However, it is bothersome and hard to manage.
 
 -> So, Set a box to manage some states globally. It is called "Redux"


### 2. Message Queue (MQ)
 -> Popular API.
 
 - Kafka: In my opinion, Kafka is used for massive data processing service. It is usually used for log collection.
 - RabbitMQ: Please refers [official homepage](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).
