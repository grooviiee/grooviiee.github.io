## WIDT(What I've Done Today)

### Research Topic is decided.

### Satellite Communication leveraging 5G cellular network.

 -> LEO (Low earth orbit) Network is one of the hottest topic in this field.
 
 -> Satellite Network deploys thousands of LEOs on the sky and use it as Base Station.
 
 -> We can use internet service everywhere without Base Station's terrestrial limitation.
 
 -> However, there are some problems remaining such as inter-operability with ground base station and node.
 
 -> In satellite communication, there are some interesting topics like beam forming (is it possible using beamforming 12,000km above?)
